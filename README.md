In this task I will calculate a userâ€™s total holiday cost, which includes the plane cost, hotel cost, and car-rental cost.

Code contents:
1) Add user inputs, like the city to where the user want to travel to, the number of nights stay and the number of days the user will have a car rental.
2) Create functions to calculate the cost of hotel, plane, car rental and take all those three arguments and calculate the total holiday cost.
3) Print out all the details about the holiday in a readable way.
4) The program can be run with different combinations of input to show its compatibility with different options.
